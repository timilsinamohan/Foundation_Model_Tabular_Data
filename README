# Project Overview
This is lung cancer relapse project for early stage lung cancer patient. This repository contains eight Jupyter notebooks, each demonstrating different foundation models sourced from the Hugging Face library. Please note that due to GDPR compliance, we are unable to provide the datasets used within these notebooks.
